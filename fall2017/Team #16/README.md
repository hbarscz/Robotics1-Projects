Project: 
Robotic Welding Seam Inspection

Description:
This is a foundation project for a machine learning based weld defect dignostic system.
The project includes: robot control, sensor control, and system integration.
Sensor SDK is a proprietory software so that part is not disclosed. 
But you can still play with the robot simulator to try out different velocity controllers.
MIT license applies here.
