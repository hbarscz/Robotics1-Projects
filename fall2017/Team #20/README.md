Project: Dynamic Modeling and Impedance Control


Description: This folder contains the code for the dynamic model control and impedance control using Baxter. It also contains the MATLAB files needed for model simulation results (outlined in final report). The python files can be directly run from a ROS terminal once created as an executible. The MATLAB files should be added to the MATLAB path. They all need to be added to the same location.
